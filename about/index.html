<p>A software engineer dedicated to crafting seamless digital experiences.</p>
<p>I’m <strong>Glenn</strong>, a frontend developer hailing from Antwerp, with a passion for using Ember.js, React, and a dash of ingenuity. My journey in tech has taken me from a start in manual testing through test automation into building web applications that perform as well as they look.</p>
<p>With a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Physics</strong> from <em>Universiteit Antwerpen</em>, I bring a strong analytical mindset to my work. My fascination with science and technology fuels my approach to problem-solving and innovation in software development. Whether I’m exploring complex algorithms or delving into the latest tech trends, my background in physics enhances my ability to think critically and creatively.</p>
<p>I’ve worked with companies like Verhaert, Bagaar and Ordina, tackling everything from frontend and backend development to streamlining and automating testing processes. When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me strumming a guitar, hitting the soccer field, jogging through the beautiful streets of Antwerp, or soaking up the vibrant music scene at concerts.</p>
<p>Oh, and in case you’re wondering, yes—this &quot;About&quot; section was indeed co-written by a large language model. But hey, I provided all the substance; it just helped with the wording!</p>
