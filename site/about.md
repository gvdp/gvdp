# About Me

A software engineer dedicated to building thoughtful digital experiences.

I'm **Glenn**, a frontend developer based in Antwerp. I work primarily with Ember.js and React, building web applications that are both functional and user-friendly. Over time, I've expanded into other areas of software development, including backend work—mainly with Laravel—giving me a more complete perspective on building full-stack applications.

My path into software development wasn't entirely straightforward. I started in manual testing, moved into test automation, and eventually found my way to frontend development—where I've been ever since. Along the way, I've worked with companies like Verhaert, Bagaar, and Ordina, handling everything from frontend and backend work to improving testing workflows.

I have a **Bachelor of Science in Physics** from _Universiteit Antwerpen_, which probably explains why I tend to approach problems methodically and enjoy diving into technical challenges. The analytical thinking from my physics background still influences how I write code and solve problems today.

Outside of work, I play guitar, play soccer, go for runs around Antwerp (just completed my second half marathon), and catch live music whenever I can.
