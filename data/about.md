# About Me

A software engineer dedicated to crafting seamless digital experiences. 

I’m **Glenn**, a frontend developer hailing from Antwerp, with a passion for using Ember.js, React, and a dash of ingenuity. My journey in tech has taken me from a start in manual testing through test automation into building web applications that perform as well as they look.

With a **Bachelor of Science in Physics** from *Universiteit Antwerpen*, I bring a strong analytical mindset to my work. My fascination with science and technology fuels my approach to problem-solving and innovation in software development. Whether I’m exploring complex algorithms or delving into the latest tech trends, my background in physics enhances my ability to think critically and creatively.

I’ve worked with companies like Verhaert, Bagaar and Ordina, tackling everything from frontend and backend development to streamlining and automating testing processes. When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me strumming a guitar, hitting the soccer field, jogging through the beautiful streets of Antwerp, or soaking up the vibrant music scene at concerts.

Oh, and in case you’re wondering, yes—this "About" section was indeed co-written by a large language model. But hey, I provided all the substance; it just helped with the wording!
